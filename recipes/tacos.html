        <p>Homemade Tacos are the perfect busy weeknight dinner. 
            These Easy Ground Beef Tacos are better than take-out 
            and ready in minutes.</p>

            <p>Traditional Mexican beef tacos are made with marinated 
                sliced or shredded beef on soft corn tortillas.  
                Those are great!  But, thatâ€™s not what most Americans think 
                of when we think of classic tacos.</p>
